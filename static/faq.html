              <h5>How can I update my email preferences?</h5>
              <p>
                Every email digest contains a link to your preferences page where you can update your email delivery preferences. You can find it as "Adjust your email preferences" on the bottom of the email. You can edit your preferences like email address, frequency, link per email etc. by using this link.
              </p>
              <h5>How can I cancel my personal pocket email digest?</h5>
              <p>
                There are two ways to cancel your email digest subscription. One way is to visit your email preferences page and uncheck  "subscribed" option. Second way is to remove access for PocketDigest app. To do that, log in to your Pocket Account and find the "Connected Services & Apps" link in your "Options" page. In this page, just click on the "Remove access" link for PocketDigest app.
              </p>
              <h5>I want to change my email address. How can I do that?</h5>
              <p>
                You can update your email address in your preferences page. You can reach your preferences page as described in question "How can I update my email preferences?".
              </p>
              <h5>Are the links delivered to me as email digest permanently deleted from my Pocket account?</h5>
              <p>
                No. We do not delete any links from your Pocket account. We archive them after we make sure that each link is delivered to you. In this way you do not lose any link. You can find your achived links under "Archive" menu in your Pocket Account.
              </p>
              <h5>Is there a way to receive the link delivered to me multiple times?</h5>
              <p>
                Yes you can do that. Just log in to your Pocket account and find the links you would like to receive again under "Archive" menu. Just re-add them into your Pocket list so you can receive them in the next email digests.
              </p>
              <h5>Do you collect my personal informations?</h5>
              <p>
                We just need your email address to deliver your links to you. This is the only personal thing we request from you. Also, once you authorize our PocketDigest app, we will have required permissions to access your Pocket account in order to deliver your saved links to you as an email digest. But do not worry. You can remove these permissions whenever you want. You can find PocketDigest app under "Connected Services & Apps" in your Pocket Account. All you need to do is to remove access for PocketDigest app. That's all.
